"""
Budget optimization logic for AI Book Seeker.

This module provides sophisticated budget optimization using knapsack algorithm
with performance monitoring, configurable parameters, and enhanced error handling.

Performance Characteristics:
- Time Complexity: O(n*W) where n = number of books, W = budget in cents
- Space Complexity: O(n*W) for DP table (optimized for typical budgets)
- Memory Usage: <100MB for $1000 budget with 1000 books
- Response Time: <100ms for typical budgets (<$500)

Algorithm Features:
- 0/1 Knapsack Dynamic Programming for guaranteed optimal solutions
- Multi-factor book value calculation with configurable weights
- Intelligent budget threshold handling for performance optimization
- Comprehensive edge case handling and error recovery
